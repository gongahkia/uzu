# `Uzu`

...

A simple browser extension that makes life *(marginally)* easier.

`Uzu` destructures [Legal Case Facts and their Judgements](https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/judgments/judgments-case-summaries) into its essential components, all from only a [Case Name](https://researchguides.smu.edu.sg/c.php?g=421855&p=2881046) *(or [Case Citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_citation))*.
